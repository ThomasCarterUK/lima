# Lima

Lima is a file based CMS and Site Builder built within PHP. Lima simply means "file" in Latin. A typical CMS or Site Builder will use a database to store pages, content and global settings. Lima simplifies that. Instead of a large, chunky database, Lima uses JSON files to load data and create pages. Not only does this allow for quick editing of pages, but it also significantly improves speed and results in a instant load time.

Lima supports the use of themes and includes a prebuilt and styled default theme.
